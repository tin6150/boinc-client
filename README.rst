boinc-client
************


boinccmd, boincmgr in a singularity container, for running things like seti@home, for burn-in test, etc.

Sometime have run enough HPL and don't need an HPL number, want an alternate test of the machine.
Some BOINC project would use GPU, instead of having to compile an nvidia version of HPL :)
